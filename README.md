## Who am I?

Trick question, let's see if I can anwer that.

🖥️ Software Engineer certified by Google and with a degree in Computer Science, passionate about technology and it's applications on our routines to make our lifes easier.

📖 Currently working on my open source pet project, [raspstore](https://github.com/murilo-bracero/raspstore), and some other personal projects. I'm also very committed to learn Golang and C++.

🪴 I also try some gardening in my free time, and even though I like it a lot, the plants seems not to.

I'm also a huge fan of cyberpunk, dark fantasy and card games.
